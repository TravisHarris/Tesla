# Tesla

This is a fan made interpretation of the Tesla website by Travis Harris, I am not affiliated with Tesla in anyway, the real website can be found at www.tesla.com

Huge fan of Elon Musk and his ventures, and I think the Tesla website is #1 on my list of favourite websites, it just has such a refreshing feel, it feels so natural, simple and forward thinking in design. So I decided to remake it for my web development portfolio, turns out making a responsive fullscreen background video isn't as easy as 1,2,3 but that was the point of doing it, to challenge myself and learn.
